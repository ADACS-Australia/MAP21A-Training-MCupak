# Introduction to Ansible

> _Ansible_ is an **agentless automation tool** that you install on a control node. From the control node, _Ansible_ manages machines and other devices remotely (by default, over the **SSH** protocol). <small><sup>1</sup></small>

> It uses a very simple language (**YAML**, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allows you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.<small><sup>2</sup></small>

> Ansible is a radically simple **IT automation engine** that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.<small><sup>2</sup></small>

> It uses **no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure**, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (**YAML**, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.<small><sup>2</sup></small>

On snowflakes and shell scripts

Many developers and system administrators manage servers by logging into them via SSH, making changes, and logging off. Some of these changes would be documented, some would not. If an admin needed to make the same change to many servers (for example, changing one value in a config file), the admin would manually log into each server and repeatedly make this change.

**Provisioning** - make sure a server, VM, computer is set up using required OS and packages

**Configuration Management** - check package/OS/application status and run required updates

**Application Deployment** - configure target VM/server/computer and copy required files/software, and check deployement success.

**Continuous Deployment** - combine with a continuous integration (CI) system to deploy a staging env; a production env on succesfully passed tests, check out from version control, CI server or package mirror.

**Security** - configure security details on control node and embed into all manage nodes automatically to investigate and respond to threats across all nodes.

**Orchestration** - manage multiple nodes and make sure front/backend services, databases, storage, etc are configured properly and in the correct order to run your service

## How Ansible works

# Concepts

---

**Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed, responsible for running the provisioning on the servers you are managing.

**Managed Node**: The machine(s) on which executes plays.
    
**Inventory**: An initialization file that contains information about the servers you are managing.

**Playbook**: The entry point for Ansible provisioning, where the automation is defined through tasks using YAML format.

**Task**: A block that defines a single procedure to be executed, e.g. Install a package.

**Module**: A module typically abstracts a system task, like dealing with packages or creating and changing files. Ansible has a multitude of built-in modules, but you can also create custom ones.
 
 **Role**: A pre-defined way for organizing playbooks and other files in order to facilitate sharing and reusing portions of a provisioning.

**Play**: A provisioning executed from start to finish is called a play. In simple words, execution of a playbook is called a play.

**Facts**: Global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces or operating system.

**Handlers**: Used to trigger service status changes, like restarting or stopping.

## Concepts

.pull-left[
- Yaml
- Ansible uses Jinja2 templating to enable dynamic expressions and access to variables
  ]

.pull-right[
- privilege escalation -> become: true 
- environment variables -> e.g. bash profile
- [including and importing](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.html#playbooks-reuse), dynamic vs static
]

# Examples, Demo & Code-Along

---

## Requirements

**Control Node**
- Python > v3.5, 
  - ansible-core 2.12 and Ansible 5.0.0 will require Python 3.8
- Windows is _not_ supported for the control node
- YAML
- SSH and SFTP

**Managed Node**
- SSH and SFTP
  - if SFTP not available -> switch to SCP
- Python if possible

**Documentation** 
 - https://docs.ansible.com/

## Installation
See [documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#) for details

`ansible`
- Includes the Ansible language and runtime plus a range of community curated Collections
- Install the latest release with your OS package manager or with `pip`

`ansible-core`
- Contains the Ansible language, runtime, and a short list of core modules and other plugins
- Install with `pip` or from source from the ansible/ansible GitHub repository (development version)

```{bash, eval=F}
# to install ansible
python -m pip install --user ansible

# to install ansible-core
pip install ansible-core
```

???

check that `~/.local/bin/` is added to the `$PATH`

one can add arg complete

```{bash, eval=F}
python -m pip install argcomplete
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete
```
